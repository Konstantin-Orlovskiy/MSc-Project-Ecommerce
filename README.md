MSc final project: eCommerce Recommender System For Increased Basket Value.

Abstract

Before eCommerce, the traditional brick and mortar stores were growing the sales by displaying the bestselling products in the most visible places. The bestsellers were more likely to be purchased in higher volumes in comparison with niche items. While this approach worked well for business to achieve increased sales numbers, there was no customer personalisation available due to limitations of physical space to do personalised placements, and lack of customer data available.

The eCommerce significantly extended the sellerâ€™s capabilities to provide the personalised customer experience on their websites. Having loads of data and capable computational capacity of modern computers to deal with the volume of data, gave a great start to developing the recommendation systems and their implementation in the industry.

This project is aiming to deliver the machine learning-based recommender system, which will stimulate the buyers to increase basket value. The system is recognising the products that represent the highest interest for the user and then bundles and discounts them in order to increase the amount user spends. User is benefiting from discounted personalised recommendations, and this leads to incremental revenue growth of the website.
